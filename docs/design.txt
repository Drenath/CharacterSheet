PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a program that allows users to input a species, class, specialization, and class skills for
the Star Wars Edge of Empire roleplaying game. Make it so that depending on the species they pick,
the different values are displayed. Also display any inputs made for class specialization, as well
as any class skills picked as well along with its rank. 
Along with this, dertermine different outputs to display depending on the different values of skills,
careers, specializations, and species.

Nouns: 
  species
  class 
  specialization
  class skills
  values
  rank
  
Verbs:
  input
